# 🎭 Workflow CLI: The Most Overengineered YAML Runner in Existence

Welcome to the **Workflow CLI** - a terminal-native alternative to [Warp's Workflows](https://docs.warp.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/warp-drive/workflows) that takes the simple concept of "parameterized commands from YAML files" and turns it into a distributed, actor-based, event-sourced, internationalized, fault-tolerant masterpiece of unnecessary complexity! 🚀

## What Does This Thing Actually Do?

At its core, this application does something absolutely revolutionary: it reads YAML workflow files (dynamicallyresolvescommandargumentsthroughinteractivepromptsbutwhocares) and... **copies the final command to your clipboard**. That's it. No execution. No running. Just good old-fashioned parameterized Ctrl+V material. Think of it as Warp Workflows for people who refuse to leave their beloved terminal.

## Features That Nobody Asked For

- 🎪 **Interactive Workflow Selection**: Choose your YAML workflow through a beautiful CLI menu (because `ls *.yaml` is for peasants)
- 🔧 **Dynamic Argument Resolution**: Interactive prompts for command parameters (just like Warp, but with 10x more code)
- 🎭 **Actor Supervision Trees**: Guardian actors watching WorkflowManager actors watching CommandProcessor actors (it's turtles all the way down)
- 📚 **Event Journaling**: Every parameter substitution is persisted as an event (because what if you need to replay that `kubectl get pods -n {{namespace}}` resolution?)
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support**: Parameter prompt errors in English AND Spanish (porque los errores de parámetros son internacionales)
- 🔄 **Command Chaining**: Workflows can trigger other workflows (because parameterized recursion is fun)
- 📦 **Pluggable Storage**: Swap between in-memory and RocksDB for persistent event sourcing (because your workflow selections are too important to lose)

## Usage

```bash
# The Warp way (modern but requires Warp)
# Use Warp's built-in workflow system with nice UI

# The simple way (boring)
# Manually edit your YAML files and copy-paste commands

# The ENTERPRISE way (exciting!)
workflow
# Interactive workflow selection → parameter prompts → clipboard magic!
# Now paste with Cmd+V like a true enterprise developer!
```

## Architecture: A Study in Overengineering

```
Guardian Actor
├── WorkflowManager Actor
│   ├── CommandProcessor Actor (Session 1)
│   │   ├── Engine (Pure Business Logic™)
│   │   ├── Journal (Pluggable Persistence™)
│   │   └── EventStore (Because Events Are Life™)
│   └── CommandProcessor Actor (Session N)
└── Supervision Strategy (Because Actors Need Babysitting™)
```

Each YAML workflow selection spawns its own CommandProcessor actor with its own Engine instance and Journal for maximum isolation. Because you never know when resolving `kubectl get pods -n {{namespace}}` parameters might crash the entire system.

## Still Not Overengineered Enough?

Don't worry! There are still plenty of opportunities to add more unnecessary complexity:

- [ ] **Distributed Mode**: Why run on one machine when you can have a cluster?
- [ ] **Blockchain Integration**: Probably?
- [ ] **Machine Learning**: AI-powered YAML file recommendations, because the hype train might end soon
- [ ] **Event Streaming**: Kafka for command events (obviously)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you can compile this masterpiece of overengineering, you'll need:

1. **Rust** (obviously) - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. **LLVM/Clang** - Required for RocksDB native bindings

#### macOS

```bash
# Install LLVM via Homebrew
brew install llvm

# Set environment variables for the current shell
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"

# Add these to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile) for persistence
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Install clang and LLVM
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang llvm-dev libclang-dev
```

#### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
# Install clang and LLVM
sudo dnf install clang llvm-devel clang-devel
```

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd workflow

# Build and install
cargo install --path .

# Or just build
cargo build --release
```

If you still don't know how to install a Rust program after reading this, you should probably go check yourself.

**Disclaimer**: No bash scripts were harmed in the making of this application. All complexity was added voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences.

**Note**: I'm so hard-headed that I debated for three days whether to use AI to help write the README. In the end, I gave in and decided to let the AI write the entire thing (like the whole CLI). All hail [vibe coding](https://vibemanifesto.org/).


**Even more notes just because I like this note at the bottom thingy**: I'll probably add gifs (and emojis) on how to use it later.

**On a more serious note**: I do use this on a daily basis LOL. Just because my memory fails me and is convenient.
